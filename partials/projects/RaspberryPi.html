                    <p>In the summer of 2014, I had ideas for web projects but nowhere to host them.</p>
                    <p>The solution? Buy a Raspberry Pi Minicomputer and make it a home webserver.</p>
                    <p>Using the Raspbian OS, I initially setup the Pi to act as a local server using traditional LAMP stack technologies.</p>
                    <p>I have since used this server to host TylerSouthmayd.com publicly, as well as some non-public work with MEAN stack technologies.</p>
