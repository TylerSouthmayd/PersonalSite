### What is this repository for? ###

[TylerSouthmayd.com](http:tylersouthmayd.com) is intended to be a pseudo-linux interactive experience to view information about me and what I do. Take control of the website through issuing commands into a command line interface - add, remove, relocate pieces of content at your whim. Remove the resume from my resume page and replace it with anything else. Too lazy to scroll? Don't, just keep pushing content to the top of the screen.
